# Event-Based Architecture? Covered! Server side rendering with React? Yep.  Scalable, production-ready code? Its here!

## Microservices are the number one solution for building and scaling out apps that are intended to grow.

## What Technology You'll Use

Because we are building a full stack application, we will use a variety of technologies. On the frontend, we'll use React and Next JS to present content to users. Each service is created using Node and Express. Data for each service is held in either a Mongo database or Redis. The entire app is deployed and runs in Docker containers executed in a Kubernetes cluster. Finally, almost all of the code in this course is written with Typescript.

## What You'll Learn

An absolute incredible number of topics are covered in this course.  Here is a partial list of what you'll do:
 - Practice patterns to create scalable microservices for a variety of app domains
 - Deploy a multi-service app to the cloud with Docker and Kubernetes
 - Write a custom implementation of an event bus
 - See best practices in communication between different services
 - Configure and scale your services using Kubernetes Deployments
 - Document and enforce structure constraints on events shared across microservices
